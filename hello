If video-doc/ appears in the list, the folder has been successfully created.
Now, if you'd like to move a video (like VID-20250704-WA0003.mp4) into the video-doc folder, run:

bash
Copy code
mv VID-20250704-WA0003.mp4 video-doc/

Great! To commit the newly created folder (video-doc/) to your Git repository, follow these steps:

âœ… Step-by-step Git Commands:
Stage the new folder (and any contents inside it, if any):

bash
Copy code
git add video-doc/
Commit the change with a message:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add video-doc folder for storing project videos"
Push to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
ðŸ’¡ Note: If git push origin main fails again with a "fetch first" error, run this command first:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main --rebase
Then push again:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Let me know once you've done this or if you want to add a video before committing.

it is not showing video doc folder when i am seeing in repo

That's expected behavior in Git! ðŸ§ 
Git does not track empty folders. So, if your video-doc/ folder has no files inside, Git will not commit or push itâ€”even if you ran git add.

âœ… Solution: Add a placeholder file to track the folder
You can add a dummy file (commonly .gitkeep) inside the folder to make Git track it.

Run the following commands:
bash
Copy code
touch video-doc/.gitkeep
git add video-doc/.gitkeep
git commit -m "Add video-doc folder with .gitkeep placeholder"
git push origin main
ðŸ“¦ After this:
Youâ€™ll see the video-doc/ folder on GitHub.

You can later remove .gitkeep when you add actual video files.

Let me know once you've done it or if you'd like me to generate .gitkeep for other folders too!
